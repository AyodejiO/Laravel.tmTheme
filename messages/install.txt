# Laravel colour scheme

Thanks for checking out this theme, based on the style presented in the official Laravel Documentation - https://laravel.com/docs. I hope you enjoy using it!

I've done my best to cover what I consider to be the common syntaxes for Laravel - PHP, HTML/Blade, JavaScript, CSS/SASS/LESS, and Markdown.

This theme also has colours for SublimeLinter and GitGutter.

If you have any suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
